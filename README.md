# Game Project C++

This is the repository for the C++ Project.

The current version of the game is using: 
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) for the graphics
- SDL2_image extension library for using images within SDL
- SDL2_tff extension library for using text within SDL

Future versions may use:
- SDL2_mixer
- SDL2_net
- [Boost.Aiso](https://www.boost.org/) for the networking

The inspiration for this game is [ShellShock Live](https://store.steampowered.com/app/326460/ShellShock_Live/)
